# YOLOv9-Powered-A-Real-Time-Driver-Monitoring-and-Traffic-Sign-Detection-System 🚦🚗

Overview:

This project introduces a real-time traffic safety system leveraging YOLOv9 to detect traffic signs and monitor driver behaviors. Designed to improve road safety, it integrates live alerts via Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology for a comprehensive user experience.

Key Features:

1️⃣ Model Performance:
Achieved 95% accuracy with YOLOv9, exceeding YOLOv8's performance (93%).

Processed 14,000+ images across two datasets focusing on traffic signs and driver monitoring.


2️⃣ Datasets:
Traffic Sign Dataset: 4,977 images detecting speed limits, stop signs, and more.

Driver Monitoring Dataset: 9,884 images recognizing driver behaviors like drowsiness and phone usage.


3️⃣ Real-Time Implementation:
Integrated with local hardware for live webcam-based detection and real-time performance during presentations.


4️⃣ Google Colab Pro:
Leveraged TPU resources to handle the computationally intensive YOLOv9 model, reducing training time significantly.


5️⃣ Innovations:
Added Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality for real-time audio alerts, enhancing the system’s usability.

Results:

🎯 Accurate Detection: Achieved high accuracy across both datasets.

⚡ Real-Time Performance: Successfully demonstrated object detection live.

🔊 Voice Feedback: Enhanced user experience with text-to-speech alerts.
